Worker-mode test262 runner.

Spawns N parallel test262_runner --worker processes, feeds tests via stdin,
collects PASS/FAIL results, enforces per-test timeouts via SIGKILL+restart,
and kills any worker whose RSS exceeds MEM_LIMIT_KB (2 GB) — runaway-
allocation tests otherwise drive the machine to tens of GB of memory
pressure (each worker can balloon at ~300 MB/s until the 10s timeout).

Default: 3 workers (max 4) to avoid OOM from multiple VM heaps.

IMPORTANT: Always prefer running a single --phase relevant to your change
instead of the full suite. The full suite takes ~6-8 minutes with 4 workers;
a single phase is usually under a minute.

This is the single canonical test262 runner. For per-test results (needed
for failure clustering), pass --log FILE — each line is RESULT<TAB>relpath
where RESULT is PASS / FAIL / TIMEOUT / MEMKILL / CE:expected-parse /
CE:expected-runtime / CE:unexpected. Cluster with e.g.:
    awk -F'\\t' '$1=="FAIL"{print $2}' results.tsv | xargs -n1 dirname | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn

Usage:
    python3 scripts/run_test262.py --phase 2    # single phase (preferred)
    python3 scripts/run_test262.py              # all phases (full validation only)
    python3 scripts/run_test262.py --workers 4  # override worker count
    python3 scripts/run_test262.py --es5        # ES5-only (skip tests with feature flags)
    python3 scripts/run_test262.py --log out/test262_results.tsv   # per-test log
    python3 scripts/run_test262.py --phase 2 --shuffle --workers 1 --no-retry-fails  # contamination detect
    python3 scripts/run_test262.py --phase 2 --fresh-process   # one worker per test (slow, clean)
