//! Idiomatic Zig wrapper over the `jse_` C embedding ABI (see `include/jse.h`).
//!
//! Design notes:
//!   - C status codes become a Zig error set, so every fallible call is `try`.
//!   - `Runtime` and `Value` own their C resources and expose `deinit`, making
//!     them `defer`-friendly. `Value.deinit` is idempotent.
//!   - Any number of runtimes may be open at once, each with its own globals,
//!     objects and interned strings. A runtime must be driven from one thread
//!     at a time; the engine has no locking and enforces nothing. Two threads
//!     each driving their own runtime share nothing and are fine.
//!   - A `Value` belongs to the runtime that produced it and carries a
//!     reference to its owner, so the reader tier is picked for you. Handing a
//!     value to a different runtime yields `error.Invalid`.
//!   - Host functions are written as plain Zig functions taking a `Ctx`;
//!     `Runtime.register` builds the `callconv(.c)` trampoline at comptime and
//!     converts a returned Zig error into a JS throw.
