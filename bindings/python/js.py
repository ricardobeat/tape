"""Pure-Python ctypes binding for the jse_ embedding ABI (see include/jse.h).

No C extension, no build step: this module dlopen()s the shared library built
by `make shared` and talks to its exported C symbols directly.

    from js import Runtime, JsError

    with Runtime() as rt:
        print(rt.eval("[1, 2, 3].reduce((a, b) => a + b)"))   # 6.0

JS values come back as Python objects: numbers as float, strings as str,
booleans as bool, null/undefined as None. Objects and functions have no Python
equivalent, so they surface as an opaque JsObject; stringify them in JS
(JSON.stringify, String(x)) if you need their contents.

Python functions go the other way with @rt.function, which makes them callable
from JS:

    @rt.function("now")
    def now(call):
        return time.time() * 1000

Several Runtimes can be open at once. Each has its own globals, objects and
strings, and they share nothing -- so a value read out of one is a plain Python
object with no tie to the engine it came from. A single Runtime must be driven
from one thread at a time; nothing enforces that.
