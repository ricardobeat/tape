# Plan 031 — Fix String Intern Table Bloat (4.7× memory regression)

**Date**: June 12, 2026
**Status**: Complete — All fixes 1-4 merged to main. Final memory: 6,512 KB (-59% vs plan start).
Fix 1 successfully implemented via selective skip-interning + lazy interning (commit 614eca0).

---

## Problem

After plan 030's object-header optimizations, `memory_test.js` RSS is 15,776 KB vs
QuickJS 6,112 KB and original Duktape 6,384 KB. Profiling reveals **78% of the gap**
comes from string concatenation.

### Data (from targeted micro-benchmarks)

| Test | duktape_c3 | QuickJS | Duktape orig | C3/QS ratio |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| String concat (2000 loops) | **12,752 KB** | 2,704 KB | 2,704 KB | **4.7×** |
| Object allocation (5000 objs) | 4,848 KB | 4,304 KB | — | 1.1× |
| String pool (5000 strings) | 3,856 KB | 2,912 KB | — | 1.3× |
| Arrays (200×200 matrix) | 3,376 KB | — | — | — |
| Prototype chains (2000) | 3,248 KB | — | — | — |

- Baseline engine overhead (empty script): 2,688 KB
- `memory_test.js` net: 12,880 KB — of which **10,032 KB is string concat** (78%)
- Object allocation is already competitive (1.1× QuickJS — plan 030 worked)

## Root Cause

### The concatenation path

For `str += String(i) + "-"` (one loop iteration, 3 allocations):

```
1. String(i)         → builtin_to_string → builtin_intern_string → str_table_insert (refcount 0)
2. String(i) + "-"   → ADD opcode → intern_string → str_intern → str_table_insert (refcount 1)
3. str += result      → ADD opcode → intern_string → str_intern → str_table_insert (refcount 1)
```

Every intermediate concatenation result enters the string table via `Heap.str_intern`
(`src/heap.c3:1953`) with refcount 1. The table **never shrinks, never compacts**.
`sweep_strings` only replaces entries with `STR_TABLE_TOMBSTONE` — no rehashing.

### Accumulated dead strings after 2000 iterations

- ~1999 old `str` values (growing accumulator: "", "0-", "0-1-", …, "0-1-…-1998-")
- ~2000 first-concat results ("0-", "1-", …, "1999-")
- Data: ~4.0 MB of dead string bodies + ~96 KB headers + 64 KB table array
- **Total dead weight: ~4.2 MB** — exactly the gap to QuickJS/Duktape

### Why GC never runs during the loop

String allocations use `Heap.alloc_no_gc` (`src/heap.c3:1154`) which does NOT
decrement `gc_trigger_counter`. Zero `Heap.alloc` calls → zero GC triggers
during the entire concat loop. Dead refcount-1 strings accumulate unchecked.

### What original Duktape and QuickJS do differently

Both engines **skip interning** for concatenation results. They allocate temporary
heap strings that are freed by refcounting immediately when their last reference
disappears — no string table entry, no permanent storage.

---

## Fixes (ranked by impact)

### Fix 1 (Primary — 78% of the gap): Don't intern ADD concat results

**File**: `src/vm.c3`
**Lines**: ~1995 (STRING+FASTINT fast path), ~2049 (generic string+string path)

Replace `intern_string(vm, buf[:total])` with non-interned allocation:

```
HString* s = hstring_alloc(heap, data, hash);
// NO str_table_insert — the string lives in registers only
// When the register is overwritten, decref → 0 triggers immediate free
reg.set_string(s);
```

Two paths in the ADD opcode:
1. **Fast path** (line ~1995): one operand is FASTINT, other is STRING → format into buffer, allocate
2. **Generic path** (line ~2049): both STRING → memcpy into buffer, allocate

Both currently call `intern_string()`. Both should switch to non-interned allocation.

**Risk**: Medium. Concatenation results that are later used as property keys will
need lazy interning. A flag bit on HString (`is_interned`) handles this — if a
non-interned string is used as a property key, intern it on demand.

**Estimated impact**: `memory_test.js` RSS drops from ~15,776 KB to ~6,000-7,000 KB.

### Fix 2 (Medium): Add a HString flag for non-interned strings

**File**: `src/hstring.c3`

Add `bool is_interned` to `HStringFlags` (there's room). New strings created
outside `str_intern` have this flag off. When used as a property key
(`PUTPROP`, `GETPROP`, etc.), lazily intern:

```
if (!str.flags.is_interned) {
    heap.str_table_insert(str);
    ((HeapHeader*)str).incref();
    str.flags.is_interned = true;
}
```

### Fix 3 (Medium): Trigger GC during string-heavy loops

**File**: `src/heap.c3`, `alloc_no_gc` (line ~1154)

Add a periodic GC trigger so dead refcount-1 strings get swept even in
string-only workloads:

```
string_alloc_counter++;
if (string_alloc_counter >= 512) {
    string_alloc_counter = 0;
    trigger_gc();
}
```

**Estimated impact**: Captures ~4 MB of dead strings during the loop.

### Fix 4 (Low): Fix `builtin_intern_string` missing incref

**File**: `src/builtins/core.c3`, line ~660

`builtin_intern_string` calls `str_table_insert` but never does `incref()`,
unlike `Heap.str_intern` (heap.c3:1966). Strings interned this way have
refcount 0 and are freed on the next RC cycle — inconsistent with other
intern paths. Add the incref.

### Fix 5 (Low, cleanup): Shrink string table after sweep

**File**: `src/heap.c3`, `sweep_strings` (line ~1709)

After sweeping, if `str_table_used < str_table_size / 4`, shrink the table.
Currently it only grows via doubling at 70% load factor — it can end up
at 8192 entries for 500 live strings.

## Implementation Order

| # | Item | Effort | Risk | Estimated RSS impact |
|---|------|--------|------|----------------------|
| 1 | Skip interning for ADD concat results | Low | Medium | **-8,000 KB** |
| 2 | Non-interned string flag + lazy interning | Low | Low | Enables #1 safely |
| 3 | Periodic GC in `alloc_no_gc` | Trivial | None | **-2,000 KB** |
| 4 | Fix `builtin_intern_string` incref | Trivial | None | Correctness |
| 5 | String table shrink after sweep | Low | None | Cleanup |

**Items 1+2 must go together** — non-interned strings need lazy interning for
key usage. **Item 3** is a simple safety net. **Items 4+5** are cleanup.

## Final Results — All Fixes Complete (commit 614eca0)

### Fix 1 Implementation (Second Attempt)

Selective interning for ADD opcode concat:
- **Accumulator pattern only** (`ra == rb || ra == rc`, e.g., `str += x`): skip interning
- **Fresh concat results** (new accumulator): intern normally
  - Rationale: Fresh results often become property keys; avoiding interning breaks lookups for them
  - Mirrors QuickJS's approach — detects re-use pattern at runtime

Lazy interning single gate:
- **Location**: `get_prop_key()` in `src/vm.c3` — STRING case calls `Heap.ensure_interned()`
- **Removed from**: `find_prop_idx()` — had it in both places caused ~70× slowdown (two `str_table_lookup` calls per property access)
- **Bug fixed**: `map["key_" + i] = v; map["key_0"]` now returns correct value
  - Root cause: `ensure_interned()` existed but had zero call sites — non-interned concat keys stored under pointer never deduplicated against string table, pointer-equality miss in `find_prop_idx`
  - Fix: call `ensure_interned()` from `get_prop_key()`

Compile-time string literals:
- `src/compiler/constants.c3` now sets `is_interned = true` for literals

### Memory Results (commit 614eca0)

| Metric | Before plan 031 | After fixes 1-4 | vs Original Duktape | vs QuickJS |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| memory_test.js RSS | 15,776 KB | **6,512 KB** | **1.04×** (6,384 KB) | **1.09×** (6,112 KB) |
| Improvement | — | **-59%** (-9,264 KB) | — | — |

### Correctness & Performance

- **Rosetta**: 43/43 passing (unchanged)
- **Shape benchmarks** (bench_shape_no_call.js, bench_shape_stress.js): ~0.9-1.0s
  - Identical to pre-plan-031 baseline (fa27a7c)
  - No regression from interning changes
  - Note: ~1s runtime is pre-existing gap vs reference engines (10-17ms for same code), tracked separately; caused by shape transition cost with 10k unique properties, not by plan 031
- **bench_memory_heavy.js, bench_object.js**: VM_ERROR (pre-existing at fa27a7c, unrelated to this plan)

## Post-completion correction (2026-06-13): fix 2 retracted

**Fix 2** (periodic GC trigger in `alloc_no_gc` every 512 string allocations, commit e6e7337) has been **removed** from main (after commit 614eca0). Two critical reasons:

### Crash bug: GC-from-inside-allocation corrupts refcount

A mark-and-sweep firing from within an allocation can free in-flight objects/strings held only in C3 locals and invisible to any GC root. Example: between `alloc_object` and the `put_prop` that anchors it, or between `str_intern` and `put_prop` for a number-to-string property key. The subsequent refcount decref double-frees the block and corrupts the FixedBlockPool free list. Reproduced reliably by running test262 `defineProperty` number-key tests (15.2.3.6-2-20/21/22) in one worker process — the worker segfaulted a few tests later. This explains why batch test262 worker runs were silently dying.

### Performance: full mark phase every 512 allocs killed shape benchmarks

The GC trigger ran a complete mark phase every 512 string allocations, making `bench_shape_no_call.js` and `bench_shape_stress.js` (10k unique properties) take ~1.0s. After removal they run in ~0.02s, matching original Duktape (~17ms) and QuickJS (~14ms). The earlier note claiming a "pre-existing ~100× shape gap" was incorrect — only commits that already contained fix 2 had been measured.

### Additional hardening retained

Sweep logic in `src/heap.c3` has been hardened and kept:
- `sweep_strings` now requires both the mark phase's **reachable bit** and `refcount==1`. Property tables and IC entries hold key strings without incrementing refcount, so `refcount==1` alone does not prove a string is dead — the old logic freed RegExp.prototype's 'ignoreCase' key prematurely.
- Sweep only runs when `Heap.string_sweep_safe` is set; no current caller enables it. `Heap.reset()` already frees all interned strings between scripts.
- Interned strings have their reachable bits cleared during mark phase 1.

### Updated final results (fix 2 removed)

| Metric | Value | Target | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| memory_test.js RSS | 6,688 KB | < 7,000 KB | Fix 1's skip-interning provides the memory win; periodic GC was not needed |
| Rosetta | 43/43 | 43/43 | Passing |
| test262 defineProperty | 1131/1131 | — | One worker, no segfaults (previously died after ~20); 898 passing |

### Related fix (same session, separate commit): PUTPROP accessor setter register corruption

PUTPROP accessor-setter calls staged their call frame at `registers A+1..A+3` and wrote the setter return value over `register A`, corrupting live caller locals. This broke test262 `propertyHelper.verifyWritable()` on every accessor property. Frames are now staged above caller `num_regs` with return value discarded.
